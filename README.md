# Portfolio Hub for DA Projects
This repository page was made with the intent of serving a information/code hub for all the portfolio work I'll be working on.

As I go through this I plan to expand this section as to improve my skills as a Data Analyst
I'm journaling all the steps on this Notion [wiki page](https://www.notion.so/b3805eb202744a2cb81092f487e1b669?v=e6b15566148741f8b3a570ff966a89d3)
